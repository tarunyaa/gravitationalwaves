# Gravitational Waves 

Gravitational waves are disturbances or ‘ripples’ in space-time. They originate from massive accelerating masses such as binary black holes or neutron stars and travel at the speed of light. The first Gravitational waves were detected by LIGO in 2015. This detection was a result of a binary black hole merger, an event dubbed GW150914. As time went on, two other types of binary mergers were detected. The first binary neutron star merger, GW170817, was detected by LIGO in 2017, and the first binary black hole - neutron star merger, GW200105, was detected by LIGO in 2020

This Project attempts to Model the Motion of Different Gravitational Waves Collision events and compare the Timescales of Collisions. More information and simulation results are included in the poster. I worked on this project with Shivani Nellore.
